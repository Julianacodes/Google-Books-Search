# Google-Books-Search

## Overview
I created a React-based Google Books Search application.

## How it Works
- To search for a book type the name of the book in the search box.
- You will then see all the books that match your search.
- If you want to view a specific book and see more information you can click the "View Book" button. 
- You can save a book by clicking the "Save Book" button.
- To view the saved books click on the "Saved Books" button at the top. 
- If you want to delete a book off the saved books list just click the "Delete Book" button.
- If you want to search more books click the "Search Books" button so you can keep on searching more books!
